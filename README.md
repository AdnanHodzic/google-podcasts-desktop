### Current state of affair with Google Podcats on desktop

Currently [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/about) is only available as an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts) and on [Google Home](https://store.google.com/gb/product/google_home) devices.

If you were listening to Google Podcasts on your phone and you wanted to continue on desktop, things would quickly get tricky. Only way this would be possible is by copying podcast URL from Google Podcasts Android App to Notes app of your choice, manually [modifying it](https://9to5google.com/2019/03/20/google-podcasts-desktop-web-app/) each time and opening modified link in a web browser.
